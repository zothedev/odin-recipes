# The Odin Project #1 - HTML Recipes Website

*Note:* See the branch "styled" the CSS version of the website.
- v1.0: HTML only - main branch
- v1.1: Basic CSS only - styled branch
- v1.2: Basic CSS + positioning - styled branch

## Project Description:
In this project, I created a recipe website that has three separate recipe pages each with their own picture, description, ingredients, and cooking steps. The website also contains a homepage with links for each of these recipes along with links to travel back to the homepage within the recipe pages.


## Demonstrated Skills:
In this project, I demonstrated basic HTML skills such as using correct semantic headings, properly adding images (including alt text), creating both ordered and unordered lists, and intuitively linking pages together using anchor elements.

I also demonstrated how to properly structure my files within my project and showed off my git skills by committing often and using strong git commit messages to help future me and other developers.

While this project is rather basic, getting in the habit of correctly following HTML and git best practices will allow me to become a better developer over time. A future project in The Odin Project (TOP) will allow me to come back to this project and spice it up using CSS.
