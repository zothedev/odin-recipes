# The Odin Project #1.1 - HTML Recipes Website Styled

## Project Description:
Previously, found on the main branch of this repo, I made a simple HTML recipes website. This sub-project is to practice applying the limited CSS that I have been introduced to. This styled recipes website isn't meant to look very good. It's simply an opportunity to put my CSS skills to use on an existing project.

## Demonstrated Skills:
In this sub-project, I demonstrated understanding of basic CSS. I utilized an external stylesheet and linked it within the `<head>` element of my HTML file. I used basic CSS properties such as `background-color`, `color`, `font-family`, `font-size`, `text-align`, and more. Additionally, I showed understanding of CSS Specificity and the *Cascade* part of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

# The Odin Project #1.2 - HTML Recipes Website Styled *and* Positioned

## Project Description:
After applying basic styles in project version 1.1, I revisited the project and
added positioning properties to the headings, recipe list, and images. I used `margin`, `padding`, `border`, and `display` types to position my elements.
Next time around, I will incorporate flexbox into my projects (as flexbox is the next topic I will be learning about in The Odin Projects curriculum).
