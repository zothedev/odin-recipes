# The Odin Project #1.1 - HTML Recipes Website Styled

## Project Description:
Previously, found on the main branch of this repo, I made a simple HTML recipes website. This sub-project is to practice applying the limited CSS that I have been introduced to. This styled recipes website isn't meant to look very good. It's simply an opportunity to put my CSS skills to use on an existing project.

## Demonstrated Skills:
In this sub-project, I demonstrated understanding of basic CSS. I utilized an external stylesheet and linked it within the `<head>` element of my HTML file. I used basic CSS properties such as `background-color`, `color`, `font-family`, `font-size`, `text-align`, and more. Additionally, I showed understanding of CSS Specificity and the *Cascade* part of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
